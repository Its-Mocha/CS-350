Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. The overall purpose of this project was to make a thermostat protype. I've made a task scheduler and coded the board to read temperatures.

What did you do particularly well? I think I coded everything correctly, commented and made the task sheduler right. Again with this course being outdated it is hard to know what I did do well.

Where could you improve? It is hard to say what I could improve about the work i've done in this class, alot of the course material was outdated prevents alot of the models not working correctly. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? Just knowning a little about the TI microcontroller and its resources where a huge learning curve. I will be adding the things i've learned from this class and try to use them in my career goals.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? I think all the skills i've used in this course will help me going forward. From breaking things up into smaller chucks to working around errors. I think the things i've learn in this class will prove useful in other projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I have used good coding practices, commented code, and descripive variable names.
